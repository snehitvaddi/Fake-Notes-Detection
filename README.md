# Fake-Notes-Detection

In this project I Implemented Deep Learning techniques with Keras and Tensrflow to predict fake notes from Bank Authentication Data Set.
Data set consists of various image features derived from images that had 400 x 400 pixels.
# Note:
Data set does not contain direct images, they are features of images.
Data set is taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication
